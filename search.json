    "text": "DSPy is a new framework for developing applications using large language models (LLMs) that aims to solve the fragility and complexity issues of traditional LLM-based pipelines. It aims to make building complex, multi-step LLM applications more straightforward and robust by providing a declarative programming model and automated optimization capabilities.\n\nDSPy provides a declarative, composable, and Pythonic syntax for building LLM-based programs, replacing the need for manual prompt engineering\nDSPy includes an “automatic compiler” that can optimize the prompts, instructions, and LM weights for each component of an LLM program, improving the overall quality and efficiency\nDSPy allows chaining together multiple LLM calls into a program, where the output of one LLM call becomes the input to the next\nDSPy introduces abstractions like “Signatures” to cleanly represent the input/output specifications of each LLM component\nDSPy is positioned as a more structured and programmable alternative to other LLM integration frameworks like LangChain\n\n\n\nIn DSPy, a Language Model (LM) is a key component used to perform various tasks such as answering questions, generating text, and making predictions. Some key points about LMs in DSPy:\n\nDSPy supports using both remote LMs managed as services (e.g. OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic) and local LMs that you host yourself (e.g. HuggingFace models)\nTo use an LM in DSPy, you first create an instance of the appropriate LM class (e.g. dspy.OpenAI for OpenAI models) and configure it as the default LM with dspy.configure\nYou can then call the LM directly with a raw prompt string, but the recommended way is to use DSPy modules and signatures which provide a more structured way to interact with the LM\nDSPy’s key innovation is its ability to algorithmically optimize the prompts and weights of LMs, especially when used in multi-step pipelines This allows DSPy to significantly improve the reliability and performance of LMs on specific tasks compared to manual prompt engineering\n\n\n\nCode\nimport dspy\nfrom groq_lm import LLAMA3_MODEL, GroqLM\n\ngpt3_turbo = dspy.OpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106\", max_tokens=300)\ngpt4_turbo = dspy.OpenAI(model=\"gpt-4-turbo\", max_tokens=300)\nllama3 = dspy.OllamaLocal(model=\"llama3\", max_tokens=300)\ngroq_llama3 = GroqLM(model=LLAMA3_MODEL, max_tokens=300)\n\n\nGroq model used today: llama3-70b-8192\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngpt3_turbo(\"hello! this is a raw prompt to GPT-3.5\")\n\n\n['Hello!

The previous trophy, the Jules Rimet Trophy, had been won for the third time by Brazil in 1970 and awarded permanently to the Brazilians. The host nation won the title beating the Netherlands in the final, 2–1. The victory was the second for West Germany, who had also won in 1954.

    "text": "In DSPy, a Language Model (LM) is a key component used to perform various tasks such as answering questions, generating text, and making predictions. Some key points about LMs in DSPy:\n\nDSPy supports using both remote LMs managed as services (e.g. OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic) and local LMs that you host yourself (e.g. HuggingFace models)\nTo use an LM in DSPy, you first create an instance of the appropriate LM class (e.g. dspy.OpenAI for OpenAI models) and configure it as the default LM with dspy.configure\nYou can then call the LM directly with a raw prompt string, but the recommended way is to use DSPy modules and signatures which provide a more structured way to interact with the LM\nDSPy’s key innovation is its ability to algorithmically optimize the prompts and weights of LMs, especially when used in multi-step pipelines This allows DSPy to significantly improve the reliability and performance of LMs on specific tasks compared to manual prompt engineering\n\n\n\nCode\nimport dspy\nfrom groq_lm import LLAMA3_MODEL, GroqLM\n\ngpt3_turbo = dspy.OpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106\", max_tokens=300)\ngpt4_turbo = dspy.OpenAI(model=\"gpt-4-turbo\", max_tokens=300)\nllama3 = dspy.OllamaLocal(model=\"llama3\", max_tokens=300)\ngroq_llama3 = GroqLM(model=LLAMA3_MODEL, max_tokens=300)\n\n\nGroq model used today: llama3-70b-8192\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngpt3_turbo(\"hello! this is a raw prompt to GPT-3.5\")\n\n\n['Hello!
