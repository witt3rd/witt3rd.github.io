## Introduction

I have spent hours following blog posts and YouTube videos on getting an end-to-end development environment going that has all the features I want:

- TypeScript with hot reload, including when GraphQL schema changes
- React with GraphQL support using hooks - not MobX, Redux, ...
- MongoDB and Mongoose using TypeScript

So, I decided to bite the bullet and build up a full stack template.
