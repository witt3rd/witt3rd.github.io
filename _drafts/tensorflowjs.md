## Introduction

Having now [played with Keras](https://witt3rd.github.io/deep/learning/ai/2018/06/13/keras.html) a bit in Python, which is used for "serious" deep learning work, we next look at [TensorFlowJS](https://js.tensorflow.org) JavaScript library, which can be used in Node or in the browser.

## Prerequisites and Setup

Please refer to [this gist section](https://gist.github.com/witt3rd/567d1e52f1e2da4f45ed72e436dc4576#tensorflowjs) for latest installation details.

## Sample Code
