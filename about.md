I'm interested in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning for AI that helps people make better decisions, faster.

Specifically, I'm interested in the synthesis of graphical representations with arbitrary function-oriented (i.e., `f: x->y`) computations (e.g., inference, prediction, classification, learning).

We are commercializing these ideas at [Maana, Inc.](https:/maana.io). We also have several open source projects at [maana-io](https://github.com/maana-io).
